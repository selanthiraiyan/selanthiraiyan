### Hello ðŸ‘‹ â€“  I'm Sharma Elanthiraiyan!
  

- I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mokriya.com">Mokriya</a> as an iOS Engineer.
- Currently, I am catching up What's new in SwiftUI and Swift. Current focus is on concurrency in Swift.
- I contribute in Stackoverflow. And, recent days, I have become interested in Open Source. I go through open source swift (iOS) projects and try to learn/contribute. 
- I speak Tamil and English. Currently, I am learning Hindi.

###### Kindly reach out if you need help on a Open source project.
